						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class="sectionNumber">3.1</span>"Less than" and "Greater than" : A Quick Review</h3>
							<p class="stuff">We have been focusing on points that lie exactly <strong>on</strong> a given line. These are points 
							that satisfy the corresponding linear equation <strong>(equality)</strong>.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">In linear programming, we often need to ask questions like this : What do I need to do 
							if I want my manufacturing cost to be <strong>less than</strong> Rs. 1000 per unit? What do I need to do if 
							I need to get <strong>more than</strong> 400 calories from eating apples and bananas, but I also want to make
							sure that I get <strong>less than</strong> 600 calories?</p>
							<p class = "stuff">These are examples of <strong>inequalites</strong> based on linear equations. Obviously,
							if we move off the line, we are saying that the LHS of the equation is now <strong>different</strong> from
							the RHS. Points on the line satisfy the equality, but points lying anywhere in the area above / below the 
							line will satisfy the inequalities.
							</p>
							<p class = "stuff">Look at the graph and think for a moment. Which area contains points where we get <strong>
							more than</strong> 500 calories? Which area contains points where we get <strong>less than</strong> 500 calories?</p>

						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class="sectionNumber">2.2</span> Line with Positive Intercept</h3>
								<p class="stuff">Now let us assume that we are getting some calories from some other sources as well. Say we are going to get 
								200 calories from other sources <strong>besides</strong> apples. So even if we don't eat any apples, we still get 200 calories anyway -- and 
								then we get more extra calories depending on the number of apples.</p>
								
								<p class="stuff">With this extra assumption, we can see that the line has an <strong>intercept</strong> of 
								200 calories. Its equation can be writtan as:</p>
								
								<p class="equation">Y = A X + S </p>
							    
								<p class="stuff"> whrere <span class="equation">A</span> and <span class="equation">S</span> represent calories
								from apples and from other sources respectively.</p>

						<div id="stuff3" class="stuffDiv inactiveStuff">
						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class="sectionNumber">2.3</span> Another form of the Linear Equation</h3>
						
						<p class="stuff">We have just seen a simple and common form of writing a linear equation. But in our
						study of Linear Programming, we will usually write the linear equation in a different way. Let's introduce
						that other form by considering an example where we look at the calories that we get by eating apples <strong>and</strong> bananas.</p>
												
										<p class="stuff">Assume that we get 50 calories per apple and 90 calories per banana. We call these
										numbers <span class="equation">A</span> and <span class="equation">B</span> respectively.</p>
										<p class="stuff">Also, assume that we decide to eat <span class="equation">X</span> apples and <span class="equation">Y</span> bananas. How many calories would we get? Obviously, the total calories will be</p>
										<p class="equation">Calories = A * X    +    B * Y</p>
										<p class="stuff">Assume that we want to eat apples and bananas in such a quantity that we get <strong>exactly
										500 calories</strong> in total. In that case our equation becomes:</p>
										
										<p class="equation">500 = A * X  &nbsp;&nbsp; + &nbsp;&nbsp;  B * Y </p>
										<p class="stuff">which becomes
										<p	class="equation">50 * X  &nbsp;&nbsp; +  &nbsp;&nbsp; 90 * Y &nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;500</p>
										
										<p class="stuff">... which is shown in the chart as default. Try answering these questions
										by looking at the graph, assuming we need exactly <strong style="background-color:#bff1c7;">500 calories</strong>:</p>
										<ul class="stuff" >
											<li>If we don't eat any apples, how many bananas do we need to eat?</li>
											<li>If we don't eat any bananas, how many apples are needed? </li>
											<li>If we eat 3 apples, how many bananas do we need?</li>
											<li>If we eat 2 bananas, how many apples do we need?</li>
										
										</ul>

							<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class="sectionNumber">2.4</span> Modifying the Calories Equation</h3>
							<p class="stuff">Up to this point we assumed that apples contain 50 calories and bananas contain 90 
											calories. What if we change these assumptions, while keeping the requrement fixed at 
											  500 calories? Let's try that now. Move the "Calories per Apple" slider from 50 to 
											  <span style="background-color:yellow; font-weight: bold; color: blue;">70</span>.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">Observe how the graph changes when you go from 50 to 70 calories per apple and back again. How
											would you explain this change? Think for a moment and then click here: 
											<button type="button" class="navBtn" onclick="showAnswer(1)">
												Show answer
											</button></p>
							<p class="stuff answer" id="answer1">As the number of calories per apple increases, the number of apples required
							                        for getting total of 500 calories, decreases. This applies also to the case
													where we eat no bananas at all (i.e. where all our calories come from apples).
													But that case is nothing but the X-intercept. Hence the X-intercept decreases if 
													we get more calories per apple. The intercept is, in fact, inversely proportional
													to the calories per apple.</p>
							
							
							<p class="stuff">Similarly, try changing the "Calories per Banana" from 90 to 120. How would you 
											describe the changes that you see? How would you explain the reason for this?</p>
						</div>
						
						
						<div id="stuff5" class="stuffDiv inactiveStuff">
							<h3 class="stuffH3"><span  class="sectionNumber">2.5</span>Need More or Less Calories?</h3>
							<p class="stuff">Up to this point, we assumed that we always need 500 calories per week. 
							Now we want to change that assumption, so we have added a new slider to set how many 
							calories we want to get from eating apples and bananas.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">Think for a moment: if we change the required calories from 500 to 300, 
											what change will happen to the graph?
											
											For example, what will happen to the X and Y intercepts?</p>
											<ul class="stuff">
											<li>Both will increase</li>
											<li>Both will decrease</li>
											<li>One will increase, the other will decrease. --> Guess which ones.
											</ul>
											
							<p class="stuff">After you guess the answers,
											try moving the new calories slider from 500 to 300. Did you guess right? Try to
											explain this change in terms of the equation of the line (review Tab 3 if you need to).</p>
