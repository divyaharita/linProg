						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class=sectionNumber>2.1</span> The Simplest Linear Equation!</h3>
							<p class="stuff">We're going to assume that you have already studied <strong>linear equations</strong>, but we will quickily 
											review what they are and look at some of their properties.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">The simplest and the most familiar form of a linear equation is:  </p>
							<p class = "equation">	Y = A X </p>
							<p class = "stuff">For example, we can say <span class="equation">Y</span> is the number of calories we get per week by eating apples. This is the product of calories per apple (<span class="equation">A</span>) and the number of apples we eat per week (<span class="equation">X</span>).</p>
							<p class="stuff">Here <span class="equation">A</span> is the <strong>slope</strong> of the equation. If we eat no apples, we get no calories --
							so the graph passes through the origin. We say that the <strong>intercept</strong> is zero in this case.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">Use the slider to change the number of calories per apple. As you would expect, the slope of the line 
							changes accordingly. Take a minute to verify one or two examples against the graph -- for example try setting 60 calories per 
							apple. Read off from the graph how many calories you would get if you ate 2 apples per week or 5 apples per week.
							Does the graph agree with your own expectation?</p>
							
						</div>

						<div id="stuff2" class="stuffDiv inactiveStuff">
						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class=sectionNumber>2.2</span> Line with Positive Intercept</h3>
								<p class="stuff">Now let us assume that we are getting some calories from some other sources as well. Say we are going to get 
								200 calories from other sources <strong>besides</strong> apples. So even if we don't eat any apples, we still get 200 calories anyway -- and 
								then we get more extra calories depending on the number of apples.</p>
								
								<p class="stuff">With this extra assumption, we can see that the line has an <strong>intercept</strong> of 
								200 calories. Its equation can be writtan as:</p>
								
								<p class="equation">Y = A X + S </p>
							    
								<p class="stuff"> whrere <span class="equation">A</span> and <span class="equation">S</span> represent calories
								from apples and from other sources respectively.</p>
								
								
												
						</div>
						
						<div id="stuff3" class="stuffDiv inactiveStuff">
						<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class=sectionNumber>2.3</span> Another form of the Linear Equation</h3>
						
						<p class="stuff">We have just seen a simple and common form of writing a linear equation. But in our
						study of Linear Programming, we will usually write the linear equation in a different way. Let's introduce
						that other form by considering an example where we look at the calories that we get by eating apples <strong>and</strong> bananas.</p>
												
										<p class="stuff">Assume that we get 50 calories per apple and 90 calories per banana. We call these
										numbers <span class="equation">A</span> and <span class="equation">B</span> respectively.</p>
										<p class="stuff">Also, assume that we decide to eat <span class="equation">X</span> apples and <span class="equation">Y</span> bananas. How many calories would we get? Obviously, the total calories will be</p>
										<p class="equation">Calories = A * X    +    B * Y</p>
										<p class="stuff">Assume that we want to eat apples and bananas in such a quantity that we get <strong>exactly
										500 calories</strong> in total. In that case our equation becomes:</p>
										
										<p class="equation">500 = A * X  &nbsp;&nbsp; + &nbsp;&nbsp;  B * Y </p>
										<p class="stuff">which becomes
										<p	class="equation">50 * X  &nbsp;&nbsp; +  &nbsp;&nbsp; 90 * Y &nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;500</p>
										
										<p class="stuff">... which is shown in the chart as default. Try answering these questions
										by looking at the graph, assuming we need exactly <strong style="background-color:#bff1c7;">500 calories</strong>:</p>
										<ul class="stuff" >
											<li>If we don't eat any apples, how many bananas do we need to eat?</li>
											<li>If we don't eat any bananas, how many apples are needed? </li>
											<li>If we eat 3 apples, how many bananas do we need?</li>
											<li>If we eat 2 bananas, how many apples do we need?</li>
										
										</ul>

						</div>
						
						<div id="stuff4" class="stuffDiv inactiveStuff">
							<h3 class="stuffH3"><span class=sectionNumber>2.4</span> Modifying the Calories Equation</h3>
							<p class="stuff">Up to this point we assumed that apples contain 50 calories and bananas contain 90 
											calories. What if we change these assumptions, while keeping the requrement fixed at 
											  500 calories? Let's try that now. Move the "Calories per Apple" slider from 50 to 
											  <span style="background-color:yellow; font-weight: bold; color: blue;">70</span>.</p>
							
							<p class="stuff">Observe how the graph changes when you go from 50 to 70 calories per apple and back again. How
											would you explain this change? Think for a moment and then click here: 
											<button type="button" class="navBtn" onclick="showAnswer(1)">
												Show answer
											</button></p>
							<p class="stuff answer" id="answer1">As the number of calories per apple increases, the number of apples required
							                        for getting total of 500 calories, decreases. This applies also to the case
													where we eat no bananas at all (i.e. where all our calories come from apples).
													But that case is nothing but the X-intercept. Hence the X-intercept decreases if 
													we get more calories per apple. The intercept is, in fact, inversely proportional
													to the calories per apple.</p>
							
							
							<p class="stuff">Similarly, try changing the "Calories per Banana" from 90 to 120. How would you 
											describe the changes that you see? How would you explain the reason for this?</p>
